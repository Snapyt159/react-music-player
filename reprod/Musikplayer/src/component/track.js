        lyrics: `Take my hand and look at me in the eye 
        There's still time left 
        Cut these chords, and kid, run for your life
        Maybe you're broken, maybe you're shattered 
        With no reasons left to try 
        But you still have so much, so much worth saving
        That you have left on the inside
        
        I know you feel like you are worthless, that your day has come
        The misery eats you alive until you come undone
        You feel like there is nowhere left to call your home tonight
        You are not alone, this is our time, and I am by your side
        My friend, this is do or die
        
        Hey kid, can you hear me?
        Don't you dare pull the trigger and throw it all away
        You have every reason left to stay alive
        All this hell you have lived and seen
        Drown it all in gasoline
        Then light a match, pull the pin
        You are not who you've been
        The past is just lessons learned
        Light it up and let it burn
        
        Never thought that it would come to this
        Who will save you?
        Fading fast, now you are cancerous
        I know you feel hopeless at the end of your rope now
        The fear is eating you alive
        So I'll be your reason, I'll be your shelter
        I will not let you say goodbye
        Have you no reason to forget your pain and swear you'll stay?
        If you kiss it all goodbye, my friend, the world will be a darker place
        I know you're scared to death, but this is not the time to hide
        You were meant for so much more, won't let you leave this world behind
        What will it take to survive?
        Hey kid, can you hear me?
        Don't you dare pull the trigger and throw it all away
        You have every reason left to stay alive
        All this hell you have lived and seen
        Drown it all in gasoline
        Then light a match, pull the pin
        You are not who you've been
        The past is just lessons learned
        Light it up and let it burn
        You will remember the day
        You burned it all to the ground
        I know you've heard this before
        But you've gotta be strong now
        This is not the end
        Hey kid, can you hear me?
        Don't you dare pull the trigger and throw it all away
        You have every reason left to stay alive
        All this hell you have lived and seen
        Drown it all in gasoline
        Then light a match, pull the pin
         You are not who you've been
        The past is just lessons learned
        Let it burn
        Let it burn
        Let it burn
        The past is just lessons learned
        Light it up and let it burn`

        lyrics: `His little whispers: Love me, love me
        That's all I ask for: Love me, love me
        He battered his tiny fists to feel something
        Wondered what it's like to touch and feel something
        
        Monster
        How should I feel?
        Creatures lie here
        Looking through the windows
        
        That night he caged her, bruised and broke her
        He struggled closer, then he stole her
        Violette wrists and then her ankles
        Silent pain
        Then he slowly saw their nightmares were his dreams
        
        Monster
        How should I feel?
        Creatures lie here
        Looking through the window
        I will hear their voices
        I'm a glass child
        I am hannah's regrets
        
        Monster
        How should I feel?
        Turn the sheets down
        Murder ears with pillow lace
        There's bath tubs full of glow flies
        Bathe in kerosene
        Their words tattooed in his veins`

        lyrics: `She never slows down.
        She doesn't know why
        But she knows that when she's all alone,
        Feels like its all coming down
        She won't turn around
        The shadows are long and she fears if she cries that first tear,
        The tears will not stop raining down
        
        So stand in the rain
        Stand your ground
        Stand up when it's all crashing down
        You stand through the pain
        You won't drown
        And one day, whats lost can be found
        You stand in the rain
        
        She won't make a sound
        Alone in this fight with herself
        And the fears whispering if she stands she'll fall down
        She wants to be found
        The only way out is through everything she's running from
        Wants to give up and lie down.
        
        So stand in the rain
        Stand your ground
        Stand up when it's all crashing down
        You stand through the pain
        You won't drown
        And one day, whats lost can be found
        You stand in the rain
        
        So stand in the rain
        Stand your ground
        Stand up when it's all crashing down
        Stand through the pain
        You won't drown
        And one day, whats lost can be found
        
        So stand in the rain
        Stand your ground
        Stand up when it's all crashing down
        You stand through the pain
        You won't drown
        And one day, whats lost can be found
        You stand in the rain`

        lyrics: `I don't like my mind right now
        Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
        Wish that I could slow things down
        I wanna let go, but there's comfort in the panic
        And I drive myself crazy
        Thinking everything's about me
        Yeah, I drive myself crazy
        'Cause I can't escape the gravity
        I'm holding on
        Why is everything so heavy?
        Holding on
        To so much more than I can carry
        I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
        If I just let go, I'd be set free
        Holding on
        Why is everything so heavy?
        You say that I'm paranoid
        But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
        It's not like I make the choice
        To let my mind stay so fucking messy
        I know I'm not the center of the universe
        But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
        I know I'm not the center of the universe
        But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
        I'm holding on
        Why is everything so heavy?
        Holding on
        To so much more than I can carry
        I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
        If I just let go, I'd be set free
        Holding on
        Why is everything so heavy?
        I know I'm not the center of the universe
        You keep spinning 'round me just the same
        I know I'm not the center of the universe
        But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
        And I drive myself crazy
        Thinking everything's about me
        Holding on
        Why is everything so heavy?
        Holding on
        To so much more than I can carry
        I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
        If I just let go, I'd be set free
        Holding on
        Why is everything so heavy?
        Why is everything so heavy?
        Why is everything so heavy?`
