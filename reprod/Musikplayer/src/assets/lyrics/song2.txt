        Take my hand and look at me in the eye 
        There's still time left 
        Cut these chords, and kid, run for your life
        Maybe you're broken, maybe you're shattered 
        With no reasons left to try 
        But you still have so much, so much worth saving
        That you have left on the inside
        
        I know you feel like you are worthless, that your day has come
        The misery eats you alive until you come undone
        You feel like there is nowhere left to call your home tonight
        You are not alone, this is our time, and I am by your side
        My friend, this is do or die
        
        Hey kid, can you hear me?
        Don't you dare pull the trigger and throw it all away
        You have every reason left to stay alive
        All this hell you have lived and seen
        Drown it all in gasoline
        Then light a match, pull the pin
        You are not who you've been
        The past is just lessons learned
        Light it up and let it burn
        
        Never thought that it would come to this
        Who will save you?
        Fading fast, now you are cancerous
        I know you feel hopeless at the end of your rope now
        The fear is eating you alive
        So I'll be your reason, I'll be your shelter
        I will not let you say goodbye
        Have you no reason to forget your pain and swear you'll stay?
        If you kiss it all goodbye, my friend, the world will be a darker place
        I know you're scared to death, but this is not the time to hide
        You were meant for so much more, won't let you leave this world behind
        What will it take to survive?
        Hey kid, can you hear me?
        Don't you dare pull the trigger and throw it all away
        You have every reason left to stay alive
        All this hell you have lived and seen
        Drown it all in gasoline
        Then light a match, pull the pin
        You are not who you've been
        The past is just lessons learned
        Light it up and let it burn
        You will remember the day
        You burned it all to the ground
        I know you've heard this before
        But you've gotta be strong now
        This is not the end
        Hey kid, can you hear me?
        Don't you dare pull the trigger and throw it all away
        You have every reason left to stay alive
        All this hell you have lived and seen
        Drown it all in gasoline
        Then light a match, pull the pin
         You are not who you've been
        The past is just lessons learned
        Let it burn
        Let it burn
        Let it burn
        The past is just lessons learned
        Light it up and let it burn
